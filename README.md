# Machine-Learning-for-User-Classification-Project
Throughout this project, i've constructed multiple classification models intending to identify the one that most accurately categorizes students into 'potential purchasers' and 'unlikely purchasers' based on their platform activity. When accurate, such predictions are of utmost importance for a business since it allows the marketing team to concentrate resources on promoting the product to the demographic most likely to demonstrate interest and gain from a subscription.
We are working on a binary classification problem , we wanna predict if a student is a purchaser (1) or not (0) based on some specific predictors .
after the data preprocessing part we moved to data modeling using logistic regression , decision trees , suport vector machine , random forest , and k nearest-neighbors .
we compared the accuracy of each model to find the one that predicts the best 
we applied the gridsearch() to optimize the parameters and find the best estimators for each model .
